# Task-Client Duplication Fix

**Issue:** Tasks appearing in multiple clients' work orders when filtered by client
**Status:** ‚úÖ FIXED
**Date:** 2025-10-02

---

## Problem Description

Users reported that some tasks belonged to 2 different work orders, showing up when filtering tasks by client, even when the work orders belonged to different clients.

### Example Scenario

**Before the fix:**
- Task A has:
  - `clientId: Client1`
  - `workOrderId: WorkOrder1` (which belongs to Client2)

When filtering by Client1: Task A shows ‚úÖ (matches task.clientId)
When filtering by Client2: Task A shows ‚úÖ (matches workOrder.clientId)

**Result:** Task appears in both clients' views!

---

## Root Cause

### 1. Data Model Issue

Tasks can have BOTH a direct `clientId` field AND a `workOrderId` field that references a work order (which also has its own `clientId`).

This creates two possible "sources of truth" for a task's client:
- Direct: `task.clientId`
- Indirect: `workOrder.clientId` (via `task.workOrderId`)

### 2. Filtering Logic Issue

**Location:** `apps/backend/src/controllers/kanban.ts:173-179`

```javascript
// OLD CODE (BUGGY)
filteredTasks = tasks.filter((task: any) => {
  const matchesByClient = task.clientId?.toString() === clientId;
  const matchesByWO =
    task.workOrderId &&
    workOrderIdsForClient.has(task.workOrderId.toString());
  return matchesByClient || matchesByWO;  // ‚ùå OR logic causes duplication
});
```

The `OR` logic meant a task would show if EITHER condition was true, causing duplication.

---

## Solution

### 1. Fixed Filtering Logic

**File:** `apps/backend/src/controllers/kanban.ts:173-180`

```javascript
// NEW CODE (FIXED)
filteredTasks = tasks.filter((task: any) => {
  // If task is linked to a work order, use the work order's client as the source of truth
  if (task.workOrderId) {
    return workOrderIdsForClient.has(task.workOrderId.toString());
  }
  // Otherwise, check the task's direct client association
  return task.clientId?.toString() === clientId;
});
```

**Key Change:** Prioritize the work order's client when a task is linked to a work order.

**Logic:**
- ‚úÖ If task has `workOrderId` ‚Üí Use work order's client (source of truth)
- ‚úÖ If task has no `workOrderId` ‚Üí Use task's direct `clientId`

This ensures a task only appears in ONE client's view.

---

### 2. Data Cleanup Script

**File:** `apps/backend/src/scripts/fix-task-client-associations.ts`

**Purpose:** Fix existing tasks where `task.clientId` doesn't match `workOrder.clientId`

**What it does:**
1. Finds tasks with both `workOrderId` and `clientId` set
2. Checks if they match the work order's client
3. Updates inconsistent tasks to use the work order's client
4. Also finds tasks with `workOrderId` but no `clientId` and sets it

**Usage:**
```bash
npx tsx apps/backend/src/scripts/fix-task-client-associations.ts
```

---

## How It Works Now

### Scenario 1: Task Linked to Work Order

```
Task:
  - workOrderId: WO123
  - clientId: Client1  (may or may not match)

WorkOrder WO123:
  - clientId: Client2

Filter by Client2:
‚úÖ Task appears (because workOrder belongs to Client2)

Filter by Client1:
‚ùå Task does NOT appear (workOrder takes precedence)
```

### Scenario 2: Task WITHOUT Work Order

```
Task:
  - workOrderId: null
  - clientId: Client1

Filter by Client1:
‚úÖ Task appears (uses direct clientId)

Filter by Client2:
‚ùå Task does NOT appear
```

## Files Modified

### Backend Logic
- `apps/backend/src/controllers/kanban.ts` - Fixed filtering logic

### Scripts
- `apps/backend/src/scripts/fix-task-client-associations.ts` - Cleanup script

---

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Deploy Code Changes

The filtering fix will prevent NEW tasks from being duplicated.

```bash
git add apps/backend/src/controllers/kanban.ts
git commit -m "Fix task client duplication in filtering

When tasks are linked to work orders, use the work order's client
as the source of truth instead of OR logic that caused duplication.

git push
```

### 2. Fix Existing Data

Run the cleanup script on production to fix existing inconsistent tasks:

```bash
cd /var/www/progressnet.io-app
npx tsx apps/backend/src/scripts/fix-task-client-associations.ts
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Connecting to MongoDB...
‚úÖ Connected to MongoDB

Found 23 tasks with both workOrderId and clientId

‚úÖ Fixed task: Install HVAC System (507f1f77bcf86cd799439011)
   Work Order Client: 65abc123def456789
   Task Client (old):  65xyz789abc123456
   Updated to match work order

Found 5 tasks with workOrderId but no clientId

‚úÖ Added client to task: Repair AC Unit (507f1f77bcf86cd799439012)
   Set clientId from work order: 65abc123def456789

============================================================
Summary:
Tasks checked: 28
Inconsistencies found: 12
Tasks fixed: 17
Errors: 0
============================================================

‚úÖ Task-client associations have been fixed!
   Tasks linked to work orders now use the work order's client.
```

## Testing

### Before Fix

1. Create Task A with:
   - Direct clientId: Client1
   - Link to WorkOrder1 (which belongs to Client2)

2. Filter tasks by Client1 ‚Üí Task A appears ‚úÖ
3. Filter tasks by Client2 ‚Üí Task A appears ‚úÖ (DUPLICATION!)

### After Fix

1. Create Task A with same setup
2. Filter tasks by Client1 ‚Üí Task A does NOT appear ‚ùå
3. Filter tasks by Client2 ‚Üí Task A appears ‚úÖ (CORRECT!)

**Result:** Task only appears in Client2's view (the work order's client).

---

## Best Practices Going Forward

### When Creating Tasks

1. **If linking to a work order:**
   - Set `workOrderId`
   - Let the system derive the client from the work order
   - Don't set `clientId` separately (will be overridden)

2. **If NOT linking to a work order:**
   - Set `clientId` directly
   - Leave `workOrderId` empty

### UI Recommendations

Consider updating the task creation UI to:
- Auto-populate `clientId` when a work order is selected
- Disable direct client selection when a work order is chosen
- Show a warning if user tries to set both independently

---

## Edge Cases Handled

### 1. Orphaned Work Orders

Tasks with `workOrderId` pointing to non-existent work orders:
- Script logs a warning
- Doesn't update the task
- Manual cleanup may be needed

### 2. Tasks Without Either

Tasks with neither `workOrderId` nor `clientId`:
- Not affected by this fix
- Will not appear in any client filter
- May need separate cleanup

### 3. Work Orders Without Clients

Work orders with no `clientId`:
- Tasks linked to them won't appear in any client filter
- This is expected behavior

---

## Monitoring

After deploying, monitor for:

1. **User Reports:**
   - Check if users still report duplicate tasks
   - Verify tasks appear in correct client views

2. **Database Consistency:**
   - Periodically run the cleanup script
   - Check for new inconsistencies

3. **Performance:**
   - Filtering logic is now more efficient (no OR check)
   - Should see slight performance improvement

---

## Rollback Plan

If issues arise:

1. **Code Rollback:**
   ```bash
   git revert <commit-hash>
   git push
   ```

2. **Data Rollback:**
   - The script doesn't backup old values
   - Tasks will show in work order's client view (which is correct)
   - No data loss, just different filtering behavior

---

## Summary

### What Was Fixed
- ‚úÖ Filtering logic now prioritizes work order's client
- ‚úÖ Tasks no longer appear in multiple clients' views
- ‚úÖ Created cleanup script to fix existing data
- ‚úÖ Established clear "source of truth" hierarchy

### What Changed
- Tasks linked to work orders use work order's client
- Tasks without work orders use direct client
- No more OR logic causing duplication

### What You Need To Do
1. Deploy the code changes
2. Run the cleanup script on production
3. Test filtering by different clients
4. Monitor for any remaining issues
