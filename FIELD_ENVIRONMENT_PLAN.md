# Field Operator Environment Implementation Plan

## Overview
Create a dedicated mobile-first environment for field operators with optimized UI/UX for mobile devices, camera integration, digital signatures, and offline capabilities.

## Architecture

### Route-Based Structure (Within Existing Next.js App)
```
- Main Dashboard: /dashboard (current admin/office environment)
- Field Environment: /field (mobile-first for field operators)
- Client Portal: /portal (future client environment)
```

### Role-Based Access Control
- Use existing authentication and permission system
- Route users based on their Personnel `environmentAccess` field
- Leverage existing role and permission middleware

### Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: Existing Next.js 14 with App Router
- **Mobile Framework**: Responsive design with mobile-first approach
- **UI Library**: Extend existing MUI components for mobile optimization
- **State Management**: Existing state management solution
- **Camera**: Web Camera API
- **Signatures**: react-signature-canvas
- **Voice**: Web Speech API
- **Offline**: Service Workers + IndexedDB

## Personnel Model Enhancements

### New Fields Added
```typescript
interface IPersonnel {
  environmentAccess: 'office' | 'field' | 'both';
  mobileOptimized: boolean; // Auto-set based on environmentAccess
}
```

### Environment Access Logic
- `office`: Access to main dashboard only
- `field`: Access to field environment only
- `both`: Access to both environments

## Technical Implementation

### 1. Role-Based Routing
```typescript
// middleware.ts
export function middleware(request: NextRequest) {
  const { pathname } = request.nextUrl;

  // Check if user is accessing field environment
  if (pathname.startsWith('/field')) {
    // Verify user has field access permissions
    // This will be handled by the authentication system
    return NextResponse.next();
  }

  return NextResponse.next();
}
```

### 2. Environment Access Check
```typescript
// hooks/useEnvironmentAccess.ts
export function useEnvironmentAccess() {
  const { user, personnel } = useAuth();

  const canAccessField = personnel?.environmentAccess === 'field' ||
                        personnel?.environmentAccess === 'both';

  const canAccessOffice = personnel?.environmentAccess === 'office' ||
                         personnel?.environmentAccess === 'both';

  return { canAccessField, canAccessOffice };
}
```

### 3. Mobile Component Library
```typescript
// components/mobile/Button.tsx
export function MobileButton({ children, size = 'large', ...props }) {
  return (
    <button
      className={cn(
        'touch-manipulation select-none',
        size === 'large' && 'h-12 px-6 text-lg',
        size === 'medium' && 'h-10 px-4 text-base',
        'bg-primary text-white rounded-lg font-medium'
      )}
      {...props}
    >
      {children}
    </button>
  );
}
```

### 4. Camera Integration
```typescript
// hooks/useCamera.ts
export function useCamera() {
  const [stream, setStream] = useState<MediaStream | null>(null);

  const startCamera = async () => {
    const mediaStream = await navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia({
      video: { facingMode: 'environment' } // Use back camera
    });
    setStream(mediaStream);
  };

  return { stream, startCamera };
}
```

### 5. Offline Storage
```typescript
// stores/offlineStore.ts
export const useOfflineStore = create<OfflineState>((set, get) => ({
  tasks: [],
  materials: [],
  reports: [],

  addTask: (task) => set((state) => ({
    tasks: [...state.tasks, { ...task, synced: false }]
  })),

  syncData: async () => {
    const { tasks, materials, reports } = get();
    // Sync with backend
  }
}));
```
