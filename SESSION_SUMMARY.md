# Session Summary - 2025-10-02

## Overview
Comprehensive audit and fixes for subscription limits and deployment issues.

---

## üî¥ CRITICAL ISSUES FIXED

### 1. Storage Double-Counting Bug

**Problem:**
- File uploads tracked TWICE in the database
- Storage showing 648,125.01GB for a user trying to upload 526KB
- Premium subscription blocked from uploading files

**Root Cause:**
- `uploads.ts:239`: `FileTrackingService.trackFileUpload()` incremented storage
- `uploads.ts:256`: `EnhancedSubscriptionMiddleware.trackCreation()` incremented AGAIN
- Every upload counted as 2x the actual size

**Fix:**
- Removed duplicate tracking (uploads.ts:256-267)
- Added validation in FileTrackingService
- Added safeguards in EnvSubscriptionService

**Files Modified:**
- `apps/backend/src/routes/uploads.ts`
- `apps/backend/src/services/file-tracking-service.ts`
- `apps/backend/src/services/env-subscription-service.ts`

**Scripts Created:**
- `apps/backend/src/scripts/fix-storage-usage.ts` - Recalculate correct storage

---

### 2. Uploads Directory Deleted on Every Deployment

**Problem:**
- File uploads being deleted after each deployment
- Production data loss on every deploy

**Root Cause:**
- CI/CD pipeline created symlink AFTER copying files
- No explicit cleanup of copied uploads directory
- Missing symlink verification

**Fix:**
- Updated `.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml`:
  - Removes uploads directory before creating symlink
  - Verifies symlink creation (fails deployment if wrong)
  - Reports file counts for monitoring
  - Better permissions (775 instead of 755)
  - One-time migration from old structure

**Scripts Created:**
- `scripts/setup-persistent-uploads.sh` - Setup/verify persistent storage

**Architecture:**
```
/var/www/progressnet.io-app/apps/backend/uploads/  [SYMLINK]
                                    ‚Üì
/var/lib/fsa-uploads/  [PERSISTENT STORAGE - NEVER DELETED]
```

## ‚úÖ COMPREHENSIVE AUDIT COMPLETED

### All Subscription Limits Validated

| Resource | Status | Tracking | Validation |
|----------|--------|----------|------------|
| Users (MAX_USERS) | ‚úÖ | Single tracking | Validated with safeguards |
| Clients (MAX_CLIENTS) | ‚úÖ | Single tracking | Validated with safeguards |
| Work Orders | ‚úÖ | Single tracking | Validated with safeguards |
| SMS | ‚úÖ | Single tracking | Validated with safeguards |
| Storage | ‚úÖ FIXED | Fixed double-counting | Enhanced with safeguards |
| Trial Days | ‚úÖ | N/A | Correct |
| Pricing | ‚úÖ | N/A | Correct |

### Safeguards Added

All limit checks now validate:
1. Value is a number
2. Value is finite (not NaN/Infinity)
3. Value is not negative
4. Handles unlimited (-1) properly
5. Handles disabled (0) properly

**Files Modified:**
- `apps/backend/src/services/env-subscription-service.ts`

### 2. Limits Validation Script
**File:** `apps/backend/src/scripts/validate-all-limits.ts`

**Purpose:** Comprehensive validation of all subscription limits

**Usage:**
```bash
npx tsx apps/backend/src/scripts/validate-all-limits.ts
```

**What it does:**
- Validates environment configuration
- Checks plan loading
- Tests limit checking logic
- Validates storage calculations
- Reports discrepancies

---

### 3. Persistent Uploads Setup Script
**File:** `scripts/setup-persistent-uploads.sh`

**Purpose:** Setup or verify persistent uploads storage

**Usage:**
```bash
sudo bash scripts/setup-persistent-uploads.sh
```

**What it does:**
- Checks current uploads configuration
- Migrates from directory to symlink
- Creates backups before migration
- Sets proper permissions
- Verifies symlink creation
- Reports file counts and sizes

---

## üìÑ DOCUMENTATION CREATED

Comprehensive guide for the uploads directory fix including:
- Problem analysis
- Solution implementation
- How the storage architecture works
- Deployment flow
- Verification steps

- Troubleshooting guide

---

## ‚úÖ CODE QUALITY CHECKS

### Linting
- ‚úÖ Frontend: PASSED (no issues)
- ‚úÖ Backend: No lint script (TypeScript compilation used instead)

### Type Checking
- ‚úÖ Frontend: PASSED (no type errors)
- ‚úÖ Backend: PASSED (no type errors)

### Formatting
- ‚úÖ Frontend: Auto-fixed with Prettier
- ‚úÖ All code formatted consistently

### Building
- ‚úÖ Backend: Compiled successfully
- ‚úÖ Frontend: Build successful (41 pages generated)

---

## üöÄ DEPLOYMENT CHECKLIST

### Immediate Actions Required

1. **Fix Production Storage Data:**
   ```bash
   npx tsx apps/backend/src/scripts/fix-storage-usage.ts
   ```

2. **Setup Persistent Uploads (Choose ONE):**

   **Option A - Immediate (Recommended):**
   ```bash
   sudo bash scripts/setup-persistent-uploads.sh
   ```

   **Option B - Next Deployment:**
   - Just commit and push
   - Automatic migration on next deploy

3. **Validate Everything:**
   ```bash
   npx tsx apps/backend/src/scripts/validate-all-limits.ts
   ```

4. **Commit and Push:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Fix storage double-counting and persistent uploads

   - Fix critical double-counting bug in file uploads
   - Add persistent storage for uploads directory
   - Add safeguards to all subscription limits
   - Add validation and recovery scripts
   - Update CI/CD pipeline for upload persistence

## üìä MONITORING

### What to Watch After Deployment

1. **Deployment Logs:**
   - Look for: "üìä Persistent storage contains X files"
   - File count should never decrease
   - "‚úÖ Symlink verified successfully" should always appear

2. **Storage Values:**
   - Monitor `storageUsedGB` in tenant documents
   - Should match actual file sizes
   - Should never be NaN, Infinity, or negative

3. **Limit Checking:**
   - Test uploading files (should work on Premium)
   - Verify other limits (users, clients, work orders, SMS)
   - Check that unlimited plans (-1) work correctly

---
